2031,"Hyoun Kim ""Faluzure""",5,   update               so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab   for father s day and i ve been loving it ever since   just as other with samsung products  the galaxy tab   has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device   since it s been over a year  i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new   as of            their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best  performance wise  are the as follows sandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow  the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read write data to the card   yes  the published rating of most all these cards  except the sandisk regular  are class    uhs i but that s just a rating    actual real world performance does get better with each model  but with faster cards come more expensive prices   since amazon doesn t carry the ultra plus model of microsd card  i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra           extreme           and extreme plus          as mentioned in my earlier review  i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s    my question was  did i want to pay over     more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned   or i could pay almost double to get sandisk s  nd most fastest microsd card the ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage  storing capturing pictures   hd video and movie playback  on my phone   so in the end  i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra   gb card   i use my cell phone  more  than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone  it s good enough for my tablet   i don t own a  k hd camera or anything like that  so i honestly didn t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time i am now a proud owner of   sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely   issues with it in my samsung devices    original review              i haven t had to buy a microsd card in a long time  the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over   years ago  but since my cellular contract was up  i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone  the samsung galaxy s   reason for this is because i knew my small   gb microsd card wasn t going to cut it doing research on the galaxy s   i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity     gb or greater   this led me to find that the galaxy s  supports the microsdxc class    uhs i card  which is the fastest possible given that class  searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only   vendors  as of april  that makes these microsdxc class    uhs   cards  they are sandisk  the majority   samsung and lexar  nobody else makes these that are sold on amazon seeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the    i ve used them the most   i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced  as well as not eligible for amazon prime  but the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk  you literally get dozens of options  all of them have different model numbers  different sizes  etc  then there s that confusion of what s the difference between sdhc   sdxc sdhc vs sdxc sdhc stand for  secure digital high capacity  and sdxc stands for  secure digital extended capacity   essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to   gb and is formated with the fat   file system  the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system  if you use an sdxc card in a device  it must support that file system  otherwise it may not be recognizable and or you have to reformat the card to fat   fat   vs exfat the differences between the two file systems means that fat   has a maximum file size of  gb  limited by that file system  exfat on the otherhand  supports file sizes up to  tb  terabytes   the only thing you need to know here really is that it s possible your device doesn t support exfat  if that s the case  just reformat it to fat    remember formatting erases all data to clarify the model numbers  i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage  what i found there is that they offer two  highspeed  options for sandisk cards  these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra  sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to   mb sec  however they are sdhc only  to make things worse  they are currently only available in   gb    gb capacities  since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage  i ruled these out the remaining devices listed on amazon s search were the sandisk ultra line  but here  confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices  cameras   mobile devices  is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt  unfortunately i m not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars  since i wasn t sure  i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices  just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue   to find the exact model number  i would go to sandisk s webpage  sandisk com  and compare their existing product lineup  from there  you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers  that is how i got mine  sdsdqua    g  as for speed tests  i haven t run any specific testing  but copying   gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutes one last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end  for example sdsdqua    g affp a vs sdsdqua    g u  a   the difference between the two is that the  affp a  means  amazon frustration free packaging   other than that  these are exactly the same   if you re wondering what i got  and want to use it in your galaxy s    i got the sdsdqua    g u  a and it works like charm

3449,NLee the Engineer,5,i have tested dozens of sdhc and micro sdhc cards  one disturbing trend i noticed is that  the speed class rating for micro sdhc is typically inflated  for example  a  class     rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least   mb s  but somehow  a class    microsdhc cards is always slower than a class    sdhc card from the same manufacturer  case in point  thepny    gb microsdhc card  p sdu  g   efs  claims to be  class      yet it can only write at    mb s maximum  while the full sizepny p sdhc  g  achieved     mb s according to crystaldiskmark

benchmark programs      mb s in  crystaldiskmark       mb s in  h testw v       this is faster than all my other microsdhc cards  including two  class     cards frompnyandpolaroid a closer look at the file transfer speed using  flash memory toolkit  revealed another nice surprise  for writing small files  this sandisk ultra microsdhc card performed just as well as its full size counterpart  thesandisk ultra sdhc  sdsdu    g affp   in contrast  all my other class    microsdhc cards perform poorly while writing smaller files  see the benchmark results i uploaded to  customer images  for details when you use a memory card in a digital camera to record hd video  it needs to store a huge video file each session  that means its sequential write speed is most critical  when used in a tablet or a smart phone  however  the card s random write speed for small files is more important  that s why in such applications  the sandisk microsdhc will perform faster than the pny and polaroid cards  even though they are also rated as  class      bottom line as of this writing  the sandisk ultra microsdhc card ia actually priced lower than other class    cards from pny and polaroid  this makes the sandisk the best value   especially if you need honest class    performance across all platforms  side notes   do not confuse this sandisk ultra card withsandisk mobile ultra microsdhc

4212,SkincareCEO,1,note   please read the last update  scroll to the bottom    i m leaving this review as   star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience i give sandisk   stars for customer service and   star for the product  for those manufactured in the past   for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix  i d give the product   stars to all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews     and then used it in a galaxy s   gs   smartphone for storage  the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty   believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions    formatting as exfat  formatting in the gs  then copying data to the card while in the phone etc     nothing worked    and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon  just rma d and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty  the problem  as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him    when used in the gs   this card will unmount itself inadvertently  may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing    this can cause the data to become corrupt  luckily was not my experience  and   or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving    mp camera pictures to the card  or mp  movies that stop in the middle of the movie  and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse  right when you take the picture  this was the issue i experienced    sandisk knows about this issue   again  sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card  call them  info below  and they will take care of it under warranty   they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it   sorry sandisk about the   star  but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution   the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones  especially their flagship gs  phones    the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras  not samsung gs  phones with cameras  obviously  and even worked fine in some phones from htc etc  that could accommodate the    gb cards  hence the   star ratings from others   the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs  phones  and maybe other samsung phones like the gs     i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly  will see in about   weeks   i purchased my card from amazon june       so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch   however  as sandisk manufactures in batches  like most of the industry   old batches of  unpatched  cards obviously exist in warehouses   i asked about a software patch i could download and was told it s not possible    hence the  hard coded patch  in the card s romso    how to take care of the problem    after speaking with the sandisk us customer support  link and info below   this is what i learned and did go to the sandisk site           call consumer products support  this is the us no         sandisk              tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs   i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs  owners too    they will then confirm your information  approve your return        min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously   and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions    btw  they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no  on the card  but i didn t and couldn t read it myself  those numbers are super small printed into the plastic    don t believe me   take a look yourself    i told the rep i couldn t read them and he said no problem  they would process without the serial no   i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in   makes sense well  that s it   problem  hopefully  solved   let s see in     weeks   the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem   kudos to sandisk for taking care of it    however  it would be nice if there was some type of communication   notice of the issue besides google info sources  forums etc   i spent hours  maybe a couple of days total hours worth  thinking it was an issue with my phone   my data transfer   oh well  that s how it goes i really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me   good luck   btw  i d give the card   stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card  tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer     if the data transfer   remaining mounted in the gs  issue never existed  pre patch of rom  of course  update               all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card   ups shipping took about   days from when i sent it  sandisk verified the warranty claim   day later and   hours later that same day  my replacement card had been shipped  waiting on the new card now  but expect to test it out very soon  early next week    will update the post after testing out the new card   just as a reference  i ve been using a   gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs  since having shipped the   gb card   obviously it s a different card and not the micro sd xc kind  other than a bit slower access speeds to the card  absolutely zero problems     well if you don t count that it s basically filled up  hence why the   gb option is great on the gs   so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc   gb cards i m happy to see that my review has helped some others out there   good luck to you in your warranty claim  my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so far update               received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago  shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window    have had it running in the galaxy s  for a few days now without any jumps  stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking   card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would  one would think it s such a short time to test after a few days of use  but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first    minutes    that s how often and how fast it was occurring  so it would seem the problem is solved  the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card   thanks sandisk   unless i update this review by next week  you will know that the problem has been fixed good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer service update               this is the last update to this review just to  close the loop    the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about   weeks now   i have not experienced any of the initial problems   sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards update               the card has been running in my gs  flawlessly since replacing it around aug   st   pretty good track record so far        months  so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured  replacement  cards for those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed  see my addition at the beginning of this review     when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product  most people start at the   star reviews to see what others have experienced   this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews  this is what i did in the beginning with this product    therefore i think leaving it at   star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review thanks to review commenter  da shocker  for his input   i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this  one more thing   to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one  take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star  a card cost          pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless    ,08-05-2013,579,1568,126,1694,1442,0.925619835,0.912138894,note   please read the last

the issue on samsung gs  phones  and maybe other samsung phones like the gs     i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly  will see in about   weeks   i purchased my card from amazon june       so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch   however  as sandisk manufactures in batches  like most of the industry   old batches of  unpatched  cards obviously exist in warehouses   i asked about a software patch i could download and was told it s not possible    hence the  hard coded patch  in the card s romso    how to take care of the problem    after speaking with the sandisk us customer support  link and info below   this is what i learned and did go to the sandisk site           call consumer products support  this is the us no         sandisk              tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs   i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs  owners too    they will then confirm your information  approve your return        min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously   and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions    btw  they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no  on the card  but i didn t and couldn t read it myself  those numbers are super small printed into the plastic    don t believe me   take a look yourself    i told the rep i couldn t read them and he said no problem  they would process without the serial no   i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in   makes sense well  that s it   problem  hopefully  solved   let s see in     weeks   the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem   kudos to sandisk for taking care of it    however  it would be nice if there was some type of communication   notice of the issue besides google info sources  forums etc   i spent hours  maybe a couple of days total hours worth  thinking it was an issue with my phone   my data transfer   oh well  that s how it goes i really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me   good luck   btw  i d give the card   stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card  tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer     if the data transfer   remaining mounted in the gs  issue never existed  pre patch of rom  of course  update               all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card   ups shipping took about   days from when i sent it  sandisk verified the warranty claim   day later and   hours later that same day  my replacement card had been shipped  waiting on the new card now  but expect to test it out very soon  early next week    will update the post after testing out the new card   just as a reference  i ve been using a   gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs  since having shipped the   gb card   obviously it s a different card and not the micro sd xc kind  other than a bit slower access speeds to the card  absolutely zero problems     well if you don t count that it s basically filled up  hence why the   gb option is great on the gs   so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc   gb cards i m happy to see that my review has helped some others out there   good luck to you in your warranty claim  my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so far update               received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago  shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window    have had it running in the galaxy s  for a few days now without any jumps  stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking   card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would  one would think it s such a short time to test after a few days of use  but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first    minutes    that s how often and how fast it was occurring  so it would seem the problem is solved  the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card   thanks sandisk   unless i update this review by next week  you will know that the problem has been fixed good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer service update               this is the last update to this review just to  close the loop    the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about   weeks now   i have not experienced any of the initial problems   sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards update               the card has been running in my gs  flawlessly since replacing it around aug   st   pretty good track record so far        months  so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured  replacement  cards for those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed  see my addition at the beginning of this review     when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product  most people start at the   star reviews to see what others have experienced   this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews  this is what i did in the beginning with this product    therefore i think leaving it at   star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review thanks to review commenter  da shocker  for his input   i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this  one more thing   to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one  take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star  a card cost          pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless    ,0.2122510822510823,0.5053936972118792,Positive

version of os you are running  the sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc card purchased from amazon  retail packaging  gets recognized just fine however when the tablet s media device a k a  mtp  application attempts to talk your pc via usb cable the tablet simply reboots  and after that the card is presented to the pc    really strange indeed this baffled me for couple of hours  firstly  i attempted to format the card  exfat  in pc and it formatted just fine  after that i attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as  mtp  application tries to communicate with the pc  this made me investigate the issue further and i determined the root cause was the fact that sandisk now seen to factory format the card with  exfat  but also somehow seen to include an  offset  of   mb at the beginning of the card which shows up as   mb unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool the solution is to get rid of that  unallocated    mb partition on the card  you could do it in pc but that might require some windows command line experience and using  diskpart  utility and what not and i do not want to confuse people here with that process  for most novice users the process should be very simple  just insert the card on the tablet and use the  native  sd card format tool under  settings  that android os       has and it will get rid of that   mb partition and happily remount it  now after this simple process the  mtp  application works just fine with pc to transfer files to the sd card without any strange reboot phenomenon not sure why sandisk formats their class    card in this fashion  they never did it with their class   cards earlier  and there s gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that   mb partition that only sandisk can give  in the end if you reformat the card in the tablet  which defaults to exfat  the card is seen to work just fine bottomline            this is an awesome   gb capacity microsd card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully  the read and write speeds are adequate enough for most audio video   picture file formats in a tablet  the glitch mentioned above forced me to give  four  stars instead of  five  stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to

created in win xp and win vista   fat     i also have a win  machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat     i had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working   my win  machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat    it only has nstf and exfat     my older computers have the older fat   format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor    hours

am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat   with my vista computer on the tablet   but after reformatting it now the card only has   gb of space available  so it was essentially reformatted the   gb card into a   gb card   i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat   if and when exfat   catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat   and exfat     this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device  unless all your files  photos  and videos are in  or will be created with  exfat   there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card   or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat   and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat   reformat option   i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat   works for you  i gave   stars because it does work  but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting   gb

123,Aleksandar Milivojevic,2,i bought   gb version of the card to use with gopro hero   black edition   it didn t work out   the card worked ok if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates   e g  worked fine in    p with protune on  or     p with protune off   however  in     p with protune on  bitrate is just shy of   mb s in this mode    much higher then with protune turned off  it was nothing but trouble   camera would sometime work  and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason   i first suspected camera  but testing with different sd cards  it ended up being sandisk s card that was at fault   my spare card  an old and cheap   gb pny  also class      worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings once it was obvious it was problem with the card  i found people on gopro s forums that had trouble with this specific card as well  well  you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself  right     anyhow  i did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of  gb file full of zeros using unix dd utility to copy  gb of zeros from  dev zero  where else would you find that many zeros     onto a file on the card   the result was that on average  sandisk s card would manage about      mb s   just barely above the bar for class    card   however  that was average over  gb   during the write test  the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops   drops were as low as  mb s   uh   i thought write speed of class    card should never dip below    mb s   for comparison  my old cheap class    pny card was chugging along at constant    mb s under the same test   no spikes and no drops in speed the card will probably work fine in most devices  as bitrates when recording     p video are often low enough and or camera might have huge buffer   but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates  and your device doesn t have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card  you may run into trouble   be wary of using it in hero  in modes that have higher bit rates  e g      p with protune enabled  sandisk s website lists part numbers as sdsdqui    g with adapter  and sdsdqua    g without adapter   this conflicts with product description on amazon   while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again  a bit too common thing   it s interesting to note  update apr          some numbers from testing the card   the test is extremely simple   write out  gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read    kb blocks of zeroes from special device  dev zero and write it onto the card      kb           gb   dd displays transfer stats once it finishes   while dd was running  i run iostat in second terminal displaying   second interval stats as a measure of current speed   this was done on the mac   dd command line can be used as is to repeat test on linux system  however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly   i choose    kb block size  as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow   using different block sizes  results are comparable   dd if  dev zero of test bs        count            records in       records out           bytes transferred in            secs           bytes sec so     mb s and all is good  right  wrong  iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this   iostat  d  w   disk disk kb t tps mb s                                                                                                                                          and so on until dd finishes writing  gb of zeros to the card      imo  the last column should never dip under   mb s for card labeled class    for comparison  same test run against samsung pro   gb micro sd card   dd if  dev zero of test bs        count            records in       records out           bytes transferred in           secs           bytes sec   iostat  d  w   disk disk kb t tps mb

card was chugging along at constant    mb s under the same test   no spikes and no drops in speed the card will probably work fine in most devices  as bitrates when recording     p video are often low enough and or camera might have huge buffer   but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates  and your device doesn t have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card  you may run into trouble   be wary of using it in hero  in modes that have higher bit rates  e g      p with protune enabled  sandisk s website lists part numbers as sdsdqui    g with adapter  and sdsdqua    g without adapter   this conflicts with product description on amazon   while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again  a bit too common thing   it s interesting to note  update apr          some numbers from testing the card   the test is extremely simple   write out  gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read    kb blocks of zeroes from special device  dev zero and write it onto the card      kb           gb   dd displays transfer stats once it finishes   while dd was running  i run iostat in second terminal displaying   second interval stats as a measure of current speed   this was done on the mac   dd command line can be used as is to repeat test on linux system  however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly   i choose    kb block size  as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow   using different block sizes  results are comparable   dd if  dev zero of test bs        count            records in       records out           bytes transferred in            secs           bytes sec so     mb s and all is good  right  wrong  iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this   iostat  d  w   disk disk kb t tps mb s                                                                                                                                          and so on until dd finishes writing  gb of zeros to the card      imo  the last column should never dip under   mb s for card labeled class    for comparison  same test run against samsung pro   gb micro sd card   dd if  dev zero of test bs        count            records in       records out           bytes transferred in           secs           bytes sec   iostat  d  w   disk disk kb t tps mb s                                                                                                                                                      and so on until dd finishes writing  gb of zeros to the card      so  samsung is on average  x faster  but more importantly it s speed is much more constant   and critically important  it never dips under   mb s

4587,Tom Dowd,2,monday  november         i put this in the galaxy s  without formatting  restarted the phone and it showed     g gb of space   i transferred all the files from the old    gb card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the usb cord   still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music tuesday  november         the card didn t show up on the phone this afternoon   no message  just no songs to play and no card according to everything i could check on the phone   i restarted the phone and got a notification that the sd card was corrupt  needed formatting and that i would loose all data on the card   i restarted the phone again  without formatting  and the card came up like it had never been missing   i am writing this on thursday        and i have not had another issue with the card december  well  i don t know what to think   the card disappeared again and i reformatted it fat   in an attempt to fix the problem   the whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud   i tried several music players and went with poweramp because of the good reviews and that i could specify the folder to play from   so poweramp is looking for the folder  mnt extsdcard music and playing the songs in all the subfolders   it is poweramp that tells me that folder is not available the card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem today  poweramp would not play and when i got home i found the music folder was gone   i also had ringtones folder and it was also gone   now  i may not be the sharpest saw in the shed  but i know i did not delete those folders   the card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted i am starting to think the problem is with the galaxy s    i had a    gb fat   card in this phone that had been in my previous htc phone   that card was not large enough to held my music so i don t know if it was disappearing or not   i wish this combination of phone and   gb card was more reliable but just don t know where the problem lies i lowered the stars from   to   but i really don t know if the problem is with the card  the phone or both   all i know is that they do not seem to be playing well together december  there was a notification on the phone this morning that the sd card was corrupted and needed to be formatted   i restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time   i reformatted the sd card using the phone  a step i don t think i have tried yet december  another minor problem i have is that the message counter gets stuck on   when i have no new messages   the only fix i have found is to restart the phone   that happened this morning and i got the corrupted card message again  but restarted again and the card came up ok december   so  the files on the card keep disappearing   the card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but poweramp  and file directory programs do not see any files on the card   i restart the phone and the files come back   very strange   i played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again  restarted the phone and all is well again december   my phone upgraded to       yesterday and the same issues remain   it is a crap shoot as to if music will play   i take a lot of photos and use the service zenfolio to store and display them   i have an app that syncs with zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone   i set this app to store the photos on the samsung sd card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away   this morning the sd card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back   it took a total of   restarts to get the music and photos back december   i have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times   very frustrating   i ordered a sandisk    gb mobile microsdhc flash memory card sdsdq    g affp today for about        and i ll see if i have the same issues   very disappointing

2799,Lazer Fers,4,i purchased the card in the sandisk packaging  so i am pretty sure it is genuine  i tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not  this one turned out to be a real sandisk card  the card came formatted with fat   i read on the web about these micro sds  and apparently they are not as fast as the full sd card version  i borrowed my brothers sandisk   gb full sd card to make comparison tests  here are my official unofficial test results using diskbench v        and h testw     test  i will give the results as an  overall  result  because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads  the results get mixed and varied to a big degree    much larger than i expected  but the numerous tests showed me a  general  trend  the trend is that the full sd cards do write faster than the microsd card  but  also remember that the microsd had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my pc while the fullsd card was put into the computer reader directly these are just my averages  but small file writes both sd cards wrote at close to   mb sec  the microsd was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to  mb sec small file reads both sd cards read at close to    mb sec at their fastest large file copies to card microsd wrote at    mb sec while the fullsd wrote at about  mb seclarge file reads copies from card microsd was   mb sec while the fullsd read at about   mb sec my conclusion my tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes  but the fullsd card was faster in many cases  but equal to microsd in most cases  the small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough  but  my only concern is with large file writes     is     mb sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera  i don t know  i have had no problem using these cards with h    movie capture for hours  i am surprised that     mb sec is enough also  never during the huge file copies to the card did i get any noticeable heating of the card itself  by touch even for an hour  i ve noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web  some stating that they felt they might burn themselves  i copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change  other than  perhaps a couple of degrees  of course  this was on a pc and not installed in a camera the card performs well for video work  and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people  i never saw a read close to    mb sec    they were very consistent at    mb sec at the highest performance i would get the card again  if the price were right ,20-10-2012,779,1,1,2,0,0.5,0.094531206,i purchased the card

2934,mad G.I.,1,i bought this card  originally for my galaxy note ii  with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader  but i could not get it to format correctly for the phone  even using third party format software i then tried it in my galaxy tab     plus      same problems i finally  and ridiculously  put the card in my nikon d     camera  i could take a whopping  k photos  on high large settings  not that i would ever need to take that many photos in one session   this was the last option i had  to use the card it worked well  taking photos of a holiday  and thankfully  it did not fail before i could get my photos onto a computer  since then  i have inserted it back in the camera  and reformatted  like you always should   and bam  one photo is good  after that  failure  every single time  so now i have a   gb card  that is capable of taking and storing one photo at a time  before i must run a  fix file system  on my computer don t waste your money on this card  over priced  not really faster than the other cards i have  and zero longevity  this may be a one off  but i think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exfat  that makes this card a loser  or more to the point  the poor customer who buys it update july     after contacting sandisk  they have offered an rma  but first they must verify that i have not tried to  recover  or  wipe  the data on the card  and i must ship it  at my expense  to taiwan  i have since emailed them in reply to the requested information  date of purchase  photos of the card  packaging ect   and i told them that the data on their is my data  and if i could have accessed the card  i would have wiped it  why should i give them my information  stored on the card  that makes me less than happy  i am guessing that they want to discourage returns  who would want to send data to a company  not knowing who will access it  and what they will do with the information contained  i would have wiped the card  but it was unreadable  unable to format  unable to do anything  i will send it to them  hoping that the information is destroyed  along with the bad card sandisk  you are asking a whole lot of your customers  and since this card has gone bad  i have had several other cards from them  go bad as well  seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods  i used to love their products  and their older flash drives are great  still using a micro cruzer that is   years old  and going strong  i have not had one single microsd card  from this company  last more than three months  since i moved to the philippines  either they send their junk to the philippines  or they have dropped qc from their business model  to create higher profit margins   update    after emailing sandisk  and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item  intact  so that they can  assess  the card  and look at recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card  they rescinded  i can only assume that they want to get the card back  to verify that it is bad  or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them  which i can understand  instead of requiring me to send the card back to them  they asked that i cut the card  and send a photo of the  destroyed  card  so they could process a new card  to be sent to me  directly in the philippines  i hammered them pretty hard in this review  and in the email i sent to them  regarding the bad card  and sometimes  you get results  in this case  i give them   stars for doing the right thing  i had no problem cutting the card  since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway  but i did have a problem returning the device  intact  with out knowing what information was stored on the card  banking  amazon account info  passwords  ect   i would have just kept the card  destroyed it  and never bought another from sandisk  with their faith restoring gesture  i will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid  i just hope that they get better at qc  i returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday  only to find out that you must have the original packaging for a replacement  i was lucky to still have one of my packages  but since i bought several of the cards  i am not sure if i gave them the matching package for the card i returned i would suggest that if you are like me  and have several devices    dslr s  galaxy tab   galaxy note    sii  lg p      that you find a way to mark each card package  and keep the package  in the case that the card should go bad  i have had more than half of my sandisk   gb cards  fail on me  in less than   months  i only buy them  because of the cards available in my area  these are the best  which is scary  with such

take a whopping  k photos  on high large settings  not that i would ever need to take that many photos in one session   this was the last option i had  to use the card it worked well  taking photos of a holiday  and thankfully  it did not fail before i could get my photos onto a computer  since then  i have inserted it back in the camera  and reformatted  like you always should   and bam  one photo is good  after that  failure  every single time  so now i have a   gb card  that is capable of taking and storing one photo at a time  before i must run a  fix file system  on my computer don t waste your money on this card  over priced  not really faster than the other cards i have  and zero longevity  this may be a one off  but i think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exfat  that makes this card a loser  or more to the point  the poor customer who buys it update july     after contacting sandisk  they have offered an rma  but first they must verify that i have not tried to  recover  or  wipe  the data on the card  and i must ship it  at my expense  to taiwan  i have since emailed them in reply to the requested information  date of purchase  photos of the card  packaging ect   and i told them that the data on their is my data  and if i could have accessed the card  i would have wiped it  why should i give them my information  stored on the card  that makes me less than happy  i am guessing that they want to discourage returns  who would want to send data to a company  not knowing who will access it  and what they will do with the information contained  i would have wiped the card  but it was unreadable  unable to format  unable to do anything  i will send it to them  hoping that the information is destroyed  along with the bad card sandisk  you are asking a whole lot of your customers  and since this card has gone bad  i have had several other cards from them  go bad as well  seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods  i used to love their products  and their older flash drives are great  still using a micro cruzer that is   years old  and going strong  i have not had one single microsd card  from this company  last more than three months  since i moved to the philippines  either they send their junk to the philippines  or they have dropped qc from their business model  to create higher profit margins   update    after emailing sandisk  and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item  intact  so that they can  assess  the card  and look at recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card  they rescinded  i can only assume that they want to get the card back  to verify that it is bad  or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them  which i can understand  instead of requiring me to send the card back to them  they asked that i cut the card  and send a photo of the  destroyed  card  so they could process a new card  to be sent to me  directly in the philippines  i hammered them pretty hard in this review  and in the email i sent to them  regarding the bad card  and sometimes  you get results  in this case  i give them   stars for doing the right thing  i had no problem cutting the card  since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway  but i did have a problem returning the device  intact  with out knowing what information was stored on the card  banking  amazon account info  passwords  ect   i would have just kept the card  destroyed it  and never bought another from sandisk  with their faith restoring gesture  i will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid  i just hope that they get better at qc  i returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday  only to find out that you must have the original packaging for a replacement  i was lucky to still have one of my packages  but since i bought several of the cards  i am not sure if i gave them the matching package for the card i returned i would suggest that if you are like me  and have several devices    dslr s  galaxy tab   galaxy note    sii  lg p      that you find a way to mark each card package  and keep the package  in the case that the card should go bad  i have had more than half of my sandisk   gb cards  fail on me  in less than   months  i only buy them  because of the cards available in my area  these are the best  which is scary  with such a high failure rate ,0.033401401230348626,0.4753751803751804,Positive
